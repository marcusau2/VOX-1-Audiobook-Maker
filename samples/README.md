## 🎬 Atmospheric Sci-Fi

**Voice Description:**
> A deep, gritty male voice. Calm but weary. The tone is serious and cinematic, like a captain recording a log entry in a quiet spaceship. Slow pacing with pauses for effect.

**Text:**
> "Log entry 492. The engine hum is the only thing keeping me company out here. We passed the event horizon three days ago, or maybe it was three years. Time stretches thin when you're this close to the void. The navigation systems are green, but the sensors... they keep picking up a ghost signal. Something is watching us from the dark."

## 🐉 Classic Fantasy

**Voice Description:**
> An elderly, warm, and raspy voice. British accent. The tone is whimsical and mysterious, like a grandfather telling a story by a fireplace. Expressive intonation.

**Text:**
> It wasn't a sword that saved the kingdom, but a whisper. The old dragon slept not on a pile of gold, but on a mountain of forgotten books. He opened one eye, revealing a slit of molten gold, and asked the knight a question that no steel could answer: 'Why have you come to a place where only memories survive?

## 🕵️ Noir Detective

**Voice Description:**
> A low, smoky female voice. 1940s film noir style. Cynical and smooth, with a hint of vocal fry. The pacing is slow and languid.

**Text:**
> It was the kind of rain that didn't wash the city clean; it just made the grime slicker. He walked into my office wearing a cheap suit and a desperate expression. I should have told him to get lost, but curiosity is a dangerous thing, and I've always lived dangerously.
