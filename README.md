## 🎙️ Audio Samples - Hear It In Action

**Create voices from text descriptions alone** - no audio samples needed!

### 🎬 Atmospheric Sci-Fi
> *"A deep, gritty male voice. Calm but weary. Cinematic spaceship captain tone."*

### 🐉 Classic Fantasy
> *"Elderly British voice. Warm and raspy, like a grandfather telling stories by a fireplace."*

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "CUDA out of memory"
- Reduce batch size in Advanced Settings
- Switch to 0.6B model instead of 1.7B
- Close other GPU applications
- Restart the app

### Slow generation
- Check VRAM usage in activity log
- Increase batch size if VRAM allows
- Try attention mode: "sdpa" (fastest)

### App won't start
- Make sure you have an NVIDIA GPU
- Check GPU drivers are updated
- Run `Launch-VOX-1-Debug.bat` to see error messages

### Installation failed
- Check internet connection
- Run installer again (it will resume)
- Manually download Python from: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-embed-amd64.zip
