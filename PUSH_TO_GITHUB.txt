EXACT COMMANDS TO PUSH TO GITHUB
========================================

Username: marcusau2
Repository: VOX-1-Audiobook-Maker


STEP 1: Create Repository on GitHub
------------------------------------
1. Open your browser and go to: https://github.com/new

2. Fill in these details:
   Repository name: VOX-1-Audiobook-Maker
   Description: GPU-accelerated audiobook generator using Qwen2-TTS
   Visibility: ☑️ Private

   ❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
   ❌ DO NOT check "Add .gitignore"
   ❌ DO NOT check "Choose a license"

3. Click "Create repository"

4. You'll see a page with setup instructions. Keep it open but don't run those commands!


STEP 2: Push Your Code
-----------------------
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run these commands EXACTLY:

cd "E:\Gemini Projects\Audiobook Maker"
git remote add origin https://github.com/marcusau2/VOX-1-Audiobook-Maker.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


STEP 3: Authenticate
---------------------
When you run "git push", you'll be asked to authenticate.

Option A - Personal Access Token (Recommended):
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Name: "VOX-1 Development"
3. Expiration: 90 days (or your choice)
4. Check the box for: "repo" (this checks all repo sub-items automatically)
5. Click "Generate token" at the bottom
6. COPY THE TOKEN (you won't see it again!)
7. When git asks for password, PASTE THE TOKEN instead

Option B - GitHub CLI (if installed):
gh auth login
(Follow the prompts)

Option C - Windows Credential Manager:
Windows may show you a login window automatically.
Just enter your GitHub username and password.


STEP 4: Verify It Worked
-------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/marcusau2/VOX-1-Audiobook-Maker
2. You should see all your files!
3. README.md should display automatically

cd VOX-1-Audiobook-Maker
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py


Method 2: Portable Version (Recommended for users)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Download just the VOX-1-Portable folder
2. Run: Download-Python.bat
3. Run: Setup-Portable.bat

MAKING UPDATES LATER
========================================

After you make changes to your code:

cd "E:\Gemini Projects\Audiobook Maker"
git add .
git commit -m "Description of what you changed"
git push


========================================
MAKING IT PUBLIC LATER
========================================

When you're ready to share with the world:

1. Go to: https://github.com/marcusau2/VOX-1-Audiobook-Maker/settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change repository visibility"
4. Choose "Make public"
5. Confirm


========================================
NEED HELP?
========================================

If "git push" fails:
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Check you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Make sure the token has "repo" scope

If authentication keeps failing:
- Try: git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/marcusau2/VOX-1-Audiobook-Maker.git
  (Replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token)

If portable setup can't download (private repo):
- Make repo public temporarily, OR
- Download manually and extract to "app" folder


========================================
DONE!
========================================

After pushing, your code will be safely on GitHub and you can:
✅ Access it from any computer
✅ Test the portable version on another PC
✅ Share it when ready (by making it public)
✅ Track all your changes with git
